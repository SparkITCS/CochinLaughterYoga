                                <p>Later many volunteers and members willingly joined hands with this yoga therapy and now we have become a large bunch comprising people from different levels of society irrespective of caste, religion, education, age group and gender.</p>

                            Apart from training sessions we are also doing various charity activities for humanity and man kind. Social gatherings among members are also a usual part of us. We used to visit he houses of the members of our group and consoles at needy times. We ourselves stood for each other raising a helping hand at any moment. We also used to make the functions among us a festival. We used to celebrate together almost all events like Onam, XMas, NewYear, anniversaries etc.

                                Laughter yoga teaches you how to laugh without using jokes and provides a safe space for you to tap into your inner child by letting go of judgement, negativity, fear and stress and replacing those feelings with love, peace, acceptance and joy.</p>
